# introduction
## the idea behind an *explorer*
i think having an *interactive explorer* for *structured data* is a requirement for a shell like
[Nushell]!  
the ability to
- traverse the data with a few quick key bindings
- peek the data at any level
- edit the data on the fly (COMING SOON)
- all while being configurable

will come very handy in a day-to-day basis for me at least :)

## why not `nu-explore`?
- it's a bit too complex for what it does to me
- the bindings are 
- the code was really hard to wrap my head around
- i wanted to have fun learning about [Nushell] plugins and TUI applications in Rust

so here we are... LET'S GO :muscle:

# installation
there are three ways to do it:
## building from source
- build the plugin
```nushell
cargo build --release
```
- register the plugin in [Nushell]
```nushell
register target/release/nu_plugin_explore
```
- do not forget to restart [Nushell]

## installing manually
- define the install root, e.g. `$env.CARGO_HOME` or `/some/where/plugins/`
```nushell
let install_root: path = ...
```
- build and install the plugin
```nushell
cargo install --path . --root $install_root
```
- register the plugin in [Nushell]
```nushell
nu --commands $"register ($install_root | path join "bin" $name)"
```
- do not forget to restart [Nushell]

## using `nupm install`
> **Warning**  
> this is a very alpha software and even requires to use the code from an unmerged PR :eyes:

> **Note**  
> this method does not even require to change the [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) as advertised in
> [*setup the Nushell dependencies*](#setup-the-nushell-dependencies)

- pull down the `nupm` module from [nushell/nupm#12](https://github.com/nushell/nupm/pull/12)
- load the `nupm` module
```nushell
use /path/to/nupm/
```
- run the install process
```nushell
nupm install --path .
```

# usage
- get some help
```nushell
help explore
```
- run the command
```nushell
open Cargo.toml | explore
```

# configuration
the default configuration can be found in [`examples/configuration`](examples/configuration) and can
be tested as follows
```nushell
$nu | explore (
    open examples/configuration/config.nuon
        | insert colors (open examples/configuration/themes/dark.nuon)
        | insert keybindings (open examples/configuration/keybindings.nuon)
)
```

# see the documentation locally
```nushell
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```

# TODO
- [ ] get rid of the `.clone`s
- [ ] handle errors properly (`.unwrap`s and `panic!`s)
- [ ] get the config from `$env.config` => can parse configuration from CLI
- [x] support non-character bindings
- [ ] add check for the config to make sure it's valid
- [ ] when going into a file or URL, open it
- [ ] give different colors to names and type
- [x] add tests...
  - [x] to `navigation.rs` to make sure the navigation in the data is ok
  - [x] to `app.rs` to make sure the application state machine works
  - [x] to `parsing.rs` to make sure the parsing of the config works
  - [x] to `tui.rs` to make sure the rendering works as intended
- [ ] restrict the visibility of objects when possible
- [ ] show true tables as such
